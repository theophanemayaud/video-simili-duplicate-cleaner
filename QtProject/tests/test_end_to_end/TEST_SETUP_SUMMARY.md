# End-to-End Test Setup Summary

## What I've Created

I've set up a comprehensive Google Test-based end-to-end testing framework for your Video Simili Duplicate Cleaner application. Here's what has been created:

## Files Created

### 1. **Test Framework Files**
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Build configuration for the tests
- `test_end_to_end.cpp` - Main test file with 5 comprehensive test cases
- `test_helpers.h` - Header file with utility functions
- `test_helpers.cpp` - Implementation of helper functions
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### 2. **VSCode Integration**
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VSCode configuration for C++ and CMake
- `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommended extensions for optimal development

### 3. **Build and Setup Tools**
- `setup_and_build.sh` - Automated setup script for Linux/macOS
- `TEST_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary file

## Test Cases Implemented

### 1. **BasicVideoScanningTest**
- Tests video directory scanning
- Validates video metadata extraction
- Ensures both sample videos are found and processed correctly

### 2. **DuplicateDetectionTest**
- Tests duplicate detection algorithms
- Verifies that the two sample videos are correctly identified as duplicates
- Validates duplicate pair detection logic

### 3. **SpaceCalculationTest**
- Tests space savings calculation
- Verifies that space to save equals the size of the smaller video
- Ensures proper size-based calculations

### 4. **AutoDeleteBySizeTest**
- Tests the auto-deletion functionality
- Verifies that the larger video (Nice_720p_1000kbps.mp4) is retained
- Ensures the smaller video (Nice_383p_500kbps.mp4) is properly trashed
- Validates file system operations

### 5. **CompleteWorkflowTest**
- Tests the complete end-to-end workflow
- Combines all previous tests into a single comprehensive test
- Validates the entire duplicate detection and cleanup process

## Key Features

### ✅ **Automated Setup**
- Temporary test directories are created for each test
- Sample videos are automatically copied to test directories
- Automatic cleanup after each test

### ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**
- Tests cover scanning, detection, calculation, and deletion
- Validates both positive and negative test cases
- Includes proper error handling

### ✅ **VSCode Integration**
- Syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for C++ and Qt
- Integrated test runner with visual feedback
- Debugging support with breakpoints
- CMake integration for easy building

### ✅ **Cross-Platform Support**
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Automated dependency installation for Linux/macOS
- Platform-specific library configuration

## Sample Videos Used

The tests use the two sample videos you mentioned:
- `Nice_383p_500kbps.mp4` (~324KB) - The smaller video that gets deleted
- `Nice_720p_1000kbps.mp4` (~650KB) - The larger video that gets retained

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using the Setup Script (Linux/macOS)
```bash
cd QtProject/tests/test_end_to_end
./setup_and_build.sh --all
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies (see README.md for platform-specific commands)
# Then:
cd QtProject/tests/test_end_to_end
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
./video-simili-duplicate-cleaner-e2e-tests
```

### Option 3: VSCode Integration
1. Install recommended extensions
2. Open the project in VSCode
3. Use CMake Tools to build
4. Use Test Explorer to run tests

## Expected Test Results

When all tests pass, you should see:
- ✅ **BasicVideoScanningTest**: Finds and validates 2 videos
- ✅ **DuplicateDetectionTest**: Identifies 1 duplicate pair
- ✅ **SpaceCalculationTest**: Calculates space savings correctly
- ✅ **AutoDeleteBySizeTest**: Retains larger video, trashes smaller one
- ✅ **CompleteWorkflowTest**: Validates entire workflow

## Benefits of This Setup

1. **Fast Feedback**: Lightweight tests that run quickly
2. **Reliable**: Uses actual video files and real application logic
3. **Maintainable**: Well-structured code with helper functions
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new test cases
5. **Developer-Friendly**: Great VSCode integration
6. **Automated**: Minimal manual setup required

## Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies** using the provided instructions
2. **Run the tests** to verify everything works
3. **Add more test videos** to the samples/videos directory as needed
4. **Extend tests** by adding new test cases in `test_end_to_end.cpp`
5. **Integrate with CI/CD** if desired

This setup provides you with a solid foundation for testing your duplicate video detection and cleanup functionality with a much lighter footprint than your existing heavy end-to-end tests.
